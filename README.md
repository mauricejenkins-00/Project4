# Project 4

Group Members: Lakshmi, Reese, Megan

Overview: For this project we will be using a given dataset to help us identify which customers will make a specific transaction in the future, no matter the amount of money transacted. The data provided has the same structure as the real data used by Santanderâ€™s Data Science team. 

We wish to make these predictions using a XGBoost model that utilizes the sklearn, and xgboost libraries. 

Using Santander sample customer datasets, provided through Kaggle, our model will include examples of hyperparameter tuning, using the model to make predictions, and plotting visualizations with matplotlib, while summarizing our findings and performing analysis. 

Resources: CSV Zip files, Tableau if needed, Jupyter Lab
Librairies Used: Pandas, Matplotlib, Sklearn, XGBoost Library


Our Goal: To create and optimize an ideal XGBoost model, to make predictions using the Santander Customer Dataset. 

Challenges Faced: 
Features for the dataset were not labeled.
Running our models took ample amounts of time when iterating over 200,000+ rows, and 100+ features.
Figuring out which features, and model parameters helped produce the closest predictions.
